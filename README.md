# Arch Linux Bash Installer Text Edition

It's actually an Arch Linux installer which doesn't use semi-gui configuration - everyrthing is set in a config file and you just adjust it to your needs.

That's not an interactive installer. For interactive, semi-graphical installation, see [ALBI](https://github.com/barteqcz/albi)
